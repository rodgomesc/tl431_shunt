- Columns are numbered 1-60 (or 1-63 depending on breadboard)

### Our Circuit Column Assignments
- **Column 11:** Fuse input
- **Column 16:** Fuse output / Resistor input
- **Column 21:** Resistor output / VOUT
- **Column 26:** Main VOUT distribution point
- **Column 36:** TL431 IC

## Step-by-Step Assembly

### ‚ö° **STEP 1: Safety First**
1. **Disconnect the battery** - never wire a live circuit
2. Set your multimeter to DC voltage mode (0-20V range)
3. Keep the battery terminals insulated (tape over connectors)

---

### üìç **STEP 2: Install Power Rails**

**Connect Battery to Breadboard Rails:**

1. **Battery Positive (+):**
   - Take a RED jumper wire
   - Connect one end to battery positive terminal (outside breadboard)
   - Connect other end to top **+ rail** (red stripe) at any point
   
2. **Battery Negative (-):**
   - Take a BLACK jumper wire
   - Connect one end to battery negative terminal
   - Connect other end to top **- rail** (blue stripe) at any point

3. **Bridge Top and Bottom GND Rails:**
   - Connect a BLACK jumper from top **- rail** to bottom **- rail**
   - This ensures ground is available on both sides

> **Result:** Both power rails are now live (but battery still disconnected)

---

### üîå **STEP 3: Install the Fuse**

**Position:** Column 11 to Column 16, Row C

1. Insert fuse lead 1 into **11C** (column 11, row C)
2. Insert fuse lead 2 into **16C**
3. Bend leads gently if needed to span the 5-column distance

**Connect Fuse Input to Power:**
4. Take a RED jumper wire
5. Connect from **+ rail** to **11C** (same row as fuse input)

> **Result:** Power flows from + rail ‚Üí Fuse input

---

### üé® **STEP 4: Install the Series Resistor (4.7kŒ©)**

**Position:** Column 16 to Column 26, Row C

1. **Identify resistor bands:**
   - Yellow-Violet-Red-Gold = 4.7kŒ© ¬±5%
   
2. Insert resistor lead 1 into **16C** (shares column with fuse output)
3. Insert resistor lead 2 into **26C**
4. Bend to fit horizontal layout

**Connect Fuse to Resistor:**
5. They share column 16, row C - already connected!

> **Result:** Power flows: + rail ‚Üí Fuse ‚Üí Resistor ‚Üí Column 26 (VOUT node)

---

### ‚ö° **STEP 5: Mark the VOUT Node**

**Position:** Column 26, Row C and Row E

The regulated 3.3V output appears at **column 26**.

1. Place a small label or marker at column 26 (you'll measure here later)
2. This is your main **VOUT = 3.3V** distribution point

---

### üîã **STEP 6: Install the Output Capacitor (680¬µF)**

**Position:** Column 26, Row E to Row H (crosses center gap)

‚ö†Ô∏è **POLARITY CRITICAL:**
1. Identify the **negative stripe** on the capacitor body
2. Insert **POSITIVE lead** (longer leg) into **26E** (top section)
3. Insert **NEGATIVE lead** (shorter leg, marked side) into **26H** (bottom section)
4. The capacitor should straddle the center gap

**Connect Capacitor Negative to GND:**
5. Take a BLACK jumper wire
6. Connect from **26H** to bottom **- rail**

> **Result:** 680¬µF filters the output voltage between VOUT and GND

---

### üî≤ **STEP 7: Install the TL431 IC**

**Position:** Column 36, Rows C, F, H

**TL431 Pinout (TO-92 package, flat side facing you, pins down):**
- **Pin 1 (LEFT):** REF (reference input)
- **Pin 2 (MIDDLE):** Anode (A) - connects to GND

2. Insert Pin 2 (Anode) into **36F** (bottom section, crosses gap)
3. Insert Pin 3 (Cathode) into **36H** (bottom section)

**Connect TL431 Anode to GND:**
4. Take a BLACK jumper wire
5. Connect from **36F** to bottom **- rail**

**Connect TL431 Cathode to VOUT:**
6. Take an ORANGE jumper wire
7. Connect from **26E** to **36H**

> **Result:** TL431 now senses VOUT and can regulate by sinking current

---

### üéõÔ∏è **STEP 8: Install the Potentiometer (10kŒ©)**

**Position:** Columns 41, 46, 51 (Row D)

**Potentiometer Pinout:**
- **Pin 1:** One end of resistor ‚Üí connects to VOUT

**Connect POT Pin 3 to GND:**
9. Take a BLACK jumper wire
10. Connect from **51D** to bottom **- rail**

> **Result:** Potentiometer forms voltage divider; wiper voltage goes to TL431 REF

---

### üß© **STEP 9: Install the Compensation Capacitor (22nF)**

**Position:** Column 56, Row C to Row G

1. Insert one lead into **56C** (top section)
2. Insert other lead into **56G** (bottom section)
3. Ceramic capacitors are non-polarized (either way works)

**Connect 22nF Top to VOUT:**
4. Take a YELLOW jumper wire
5. Connect from **56C** to **26C**

**Connect 22nF Bottom to REF:**
6. Take a GREEN jumper wire
7. Connect from **56G** to **46D** (shares with pot wiper)

> **Result:** 22nF stabilizes the feedback loop between VOUT and REF

## ‚ö° Power-Up and Adjustment

### **STEP 10: Initial Power-Up**

1. **Set multimeter to DC voltage (20V range)**
2. Connect multimeter BLACK probe to GND (bottom - rail or 26H)
3. Connect multimeter RED probe to VOUT (column 26, row E or C)
4. **Double-check polarity** - red to VOUT, black to GND
5. **Connect battery** positive and negative terminals
6. **Observe multimeter reading**

**Expected Reading:** Between 2.0V and 5.0V (depends on pot position)

‚ö†Ô∏è **If you see:**
- **0V:** Check connections, fuse may be blown, or TL431 shorted
- **11.1V:** TL431 not regulating - check pin connections and polarity
- **Negative voltage:** Reverse multimeter probes

---

### **STEP 11: Adjust to 3.3V**

1. Locate the **adjustment screw** on the potentiometer
2. Using a small flathead screwdriver, **slowly turn clockwise or counter-clockwise**
3. Watch the multimeter display
4. **Target voltage: 3.30V ¬±0.05V**

**Adjustment Tips:**
- Turn **very slowly** - small movements change voltage significantly
- If voltage increases when turning clockwise, continue that direction
- If voltage decreases, reverse direction
- Once close to 3.30V, make tiny adjustments (1/16 turns)

**Final Target:** **3.30V** on the multimeter

---

### **STEP 12: Load Test (Optional)**

To verify regulation under load:

1. Connect a resistor (e.g., 330Œ©) between VOUT and GND
   - This draws ~10mA load current
2. Voltage should remain at 3.30V ¬±0.05V
3. If voltage drops significantly, your load is too high for this design

‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Limit:** With 4.7kŒ© series resistor, maximum load current is ~1.5mA

---

## üìä Expected Results

| **Parameter** | **Value** |
|---------------|-----------|
| Input Voltage | 10.5V - 12.6V (3S LiPo range) |
| Output Voltage | 3.30V (adjustable 2.5V - 5V) |
| Output Ripple | <50mV (with 680¬µF cap) |
| Load Current | <1.5mA (limited by 4.7kŒ©) |
| Regulation | ¬±50mV across input range |
| Quiescent Current | ~2mA (TL431 + divider) |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### **Problem: No voltage at output (0V)**

**Possible Causes:**
1. ‚úÖ Check fuse - may be blown
2. ‚úÖ Verify battery voltage (should be >10V)
3. ‚úÖ Check 4.7kŒ© resistor - may be open circuit
4. ‚úÖ TL431 may be damaged or inserted backwards

**Solutions:**
- Replace fuse if blown
- Check battery with multimeter
- Measure resistor with ohmmeter (should be ~4.7kŒ©)
- Verify TL431 pinout (pin 1 = REF, pin 2 = A, pin 3 = K)

---

### **Problem: Output voltage equals input (11.1V)**

**Possible Causes:**
1. ‚úÖ TL431 not regulating (REF pin not connected)
2. ‚úÖ Potentiometer not connected properly
3. ‚úÖ TL431 anode not grounded

**Solutions:**
- Verify GREEN wire from pot wiper (46D) to TL431 REF (36C)
- Check BLACK wire from TL431 anode (36F) to GND rail
- Ensure pot pin 3 (51D) is grounded

---

### **Problem: Cannot adjust voltage / stuck at one value**

**Possible Causes:**
1. ‚úÖ Potentiometer broken or not making contact
2. ‚úÖ Wiper pin not connected to REF
3. ‚úÖ 22nF capacitor shorted

**Solutions:**
- Measure resistance across pot pins (should change when turning)
- Re-seat pot firmly into breadboard holes
- Check continuity from wiper to REF pin

---

### **Problem: Voltage unstable / oscillating**

**Possible Causes:**
1. ‚úÖ Missing 22nF compensation capacitor
2. ‚úÖ 680¬µF capacitor installed backwards
3. ‚úÖ Poor breadboard contacts

**Solutions:**
- Verify 22nF between VOUT and REF
- Check 680¬µF polarity (+ to VOUT, - to GND)
- Re-insert components firmly; try different rows

---

### **Problem: Output voltage too low (<2.5V)**

**Possible Causes:**
1. ‚úÖ Load current too high (>1.5mA)
2. ‚úÖ Series resistor value too high
3. ‚úÖ TL431 in current limit

**Solutions:**
- Remove load and measure again
- Verify 4.7kŒ© resistor (color bands: Yellow-Violet-Red)
- Reduce load current or use smaller series resistor (WARNING: recalculate!)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Notes

1. **LiPo Battery Safety:**
   - Never discharge below 3.0V per cell (9.0V total)
   - Use a LiPo-safe charging bag
   - Disconnect when not in use
   - Monitor battery temperature

2. **Polarity:**
   - Double-check 680¬µF capacitor polarity (+ to VOUT)
   - Reverse polarity can cause explosion
   - Always verify with multimeter before applying power

3. **Current Limits:**
   - This circuit provides only ~1.5mA maximum
   - Do not connect high-current loads (e.g., motors, LEDs without resistor)
   - For higher currents, use a buck converter module

4. **First Power-Up:**
   - Always use a current-limited power supply for testing if possible
   - Have fuse rating appropriate for your circuit (3A protects battery)

   - Replace 4.7kŒ© with smaller value (e.g., 330Œ© for ~20mA)

2. **Fixed Output (Remove Potentiometer):**
   - Calculate fixed resistor divider:
     - R1 (VOUT to REF) = 3.23kŒ© (use 3.3kŒ©)
     - R2 (REF to GND) = 10kŒ©
   - Replace pot with these two resistors

3. **PCB Version:**
   - Design a permanent PCB for reliability
   - Add screw terminals for battery and output
   - Include power LED indicator
